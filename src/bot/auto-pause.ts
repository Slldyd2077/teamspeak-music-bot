 * "empty channel" — it means the underlying `clientlist` query failed (e.g. the
 * full-client `clientlist` command times out when other clients are present,
 * and `getClientsInChannel()` returns `[]` on error). Treating that failure as
 * "empty" is what caused playback to auto-pause within seconds whenever a
 * listener was actually in the channel. When the result is indeterminate we
 * return `null` so callers skip the auto-pause/idle decision entirely rather
 * than mis-reading an unknown state as empty.
